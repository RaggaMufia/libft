A project that reproduces the behavoiurs of selected Standard C library functions.
There is an exception, however, on two functions that I define by myself, namely
  * ft_putchar()
  * ft_putstr()
 they fail to accomodate the unicode character formats, but that is an extreme test anyway.
 
 Fun project this was, not an easy road but quite neccessary.
